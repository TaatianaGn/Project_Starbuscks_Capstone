## About the Project 

The project is a representation of an experiment development for Starbucks. The data simulates how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers.Â <br>
Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. <br>
Each person in the simulation has some hidden traits that influence their purchasing patterns and are associated with their observable traits. People produce various events, including receiving offers, opening offers, and making purchases.<br>
The basic task is to use the data to identify which groups of people are most responsive to each type of offer, and how best to present each type of offer.<br>

## Summary

Understanding and define which are the groups and offers that really excited people. 
Build a machine learning model that predict offer success based on the demographic information and the offer details that are provided in the data.


## File Descriptions

This github repo contains

* Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb -> Consists of a notebook with all the work. 
* model_data_prepared.csv -> Consists of a database with the cleaned and prepared data for model.
* Package Version.txt -> Consist of a list with all the libraries and packages.


## Acknowledgement

Data used in this project is taken from Starbucks in three files:

* portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
* profile.json - demographic data for each customer
* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
